# MDC (MuTMS Docker Containers) for OrbStack

MDC is a set of scripts that simplifies setting up [Moodleâ„¢ LMS](https://moodle.org/) development
and test environments on Apple macOS using [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) container manager.
MDC is a fork of [moodle-docker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker).

**Features**

* No need to understand Docker commands and parameters
* No need for Homebrew or MacPorts installation
* Easy configuration via `mdc.env`, `mdc-config.php` and `mdc-compose.yaml` files
* Useful helper scripts for everyday tasks
* Backup and restore of Moodle test site data
* Noticeably better performance compared to Docker Desktop for Mac
* [Container domains](https://docs.orbstack.dev/docker/domains) with https instead of confusing port forwarding
* Fast native [OrbStack app](https://docs.orbstack.dev/menu-bar)
* Amazing [OrbStack debug shell](https://docs.orbstack.dev/features/debug)
* All Moodle supported PHP versions available (including commonly used PHP extensions enabled)
* Supported database servers - PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL and MS SQL Server
* Behat/Selenium configurations for Chromium, Chrome and Firefox
* Behat browser inspection via "vnc://selenium.<project_directory_name>.orb.local"
* Behat browser inspection via "chrome://inspect" (Chrome/Chromium only)
* Catch-all SMTP server and email web interface using [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit)

_From maintainer: This tool if for lazy Moodle devs like me who do not like CLI scripting. Some of the used bash scripts are probably a bit naive and silly, please help me fix them if you care._

## Prerequisites

* macOS 14 or newer is required (Windows and Linux are not compatible)
* latest version of [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) installed
* basic macOS command line usage skills required

## Quick start

1. Open terminal and cd to your projects directory
2. Clone __mdc__ repository (or extract downloaded package into mdc directory):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mutms/mdc.git
```
3. Clone __moodle__ repository (or extract downloaded package into moodle directory):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moodle/moodle.git
```
4. Create empty `mdc.env` settings file:
```bash
cd moodle
touch mdc.env
```
5. Add `mdc/bin` directory to your search path in `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/mdc/bin
```
6. Open terminal, cd to your moodle directory and execute `mdc-rebuild` script:
```bash
cd /path/to/moodle
mdc-rebuild
```
7. You can complete the test site installation at [https://webserver.moodle.orb.local/](https://webserver.moodle.orb.local/).
   Alternatively you can complete the test site installation from CLI:
```bash
cd /path/to/moodle
site-install --agree-license --adminpass="testpassword"
```
9. You can review all outgoing emails at [https://mailpit.moodle.orb.local/](https://mailpit.moodle.orb.local/).
10. When you are finished with testing you can delete the containers:
```bash
cd /path/to/moodle
mdc-down
```

## Backup and restore

Commands `mdc-rebuild` and `mdc-down` are deleting all site data (Moodle database and dataroot files). Without
backup and restore scripts it would not be possible to change settings of existing containers.

MDC backup/restore works only for the same database type, it is not possible to back up data on PostgreSQL
and later restore them in MySQL.

In default installation the backup files are stored in `~/.mdc/backups/` subdirectory. It is possible
to change the location by setting a different value for `MDC_BACKUP_PATH` in `mdc.env` file.

Example of backup and restore:

1. backup data:
```bash
cd /path/to/moodle/
mdc-backup mybackup123
```
2. alter mdc.env file or login and change some Moodle data
3. purge all site data
```bash
mdc-rebuild
```
4. restore data into empty containers:
```bash
cd /path/to/moodle/
mdc-restore mybackup123
```

## MDC commands

_MDC commands_ are helper scripts located in mdc/bin/ directory. You can get help for most of the commands
by executing them with --help parameter. 

In recent macOS revisions the default shell is _Z Shell_. To allow trouble free use of MDC it is recommended
to add mdc/bin to your search path in interactive terminals by adding following into your `~/.zshrc` file:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/mdc/bin
```

Please note that MDC commands can only be executed from directories with `mdc.env` file.

List of often used MDC commands with short descriptions:

* `mdc-rebuild` - delete existing project containers if they exist, build Docker compose file and launch new containers
* `mdc-stop` - stop project containers, keep existing site data
* `mdc-start` - start existing project containers, using initial configuration and existing site data
* `mdc-restart` - stop and start project containers keeping current configuration and site data
* `mdc-down` - stop and delete project containers, site data and configuration
* `mdc-backup mybackupname` - create backup named 'mybackupname' using current site data
* `mdc-restore mybackupname` - restore back 'mybackupname' into empty project containers (requires mdc-rebuild)
* `site-install --agree-license --adminpass="testpassword"` - install Moodle in empty project containers
* `mdc-php admin/cli/upgrade.php` - execute PHP script using relative path, in this example existing site upgrade is performed
* `phpunit-init` - initialise PHPUnit test environment
* `phpunit --filter=enrol_manual` - run PHPUnit tests, in this example limiting scope to enrol_manual plugin
* `behat-init` - initialise Behat testing environment
* `behat --tags=@enrol_manual` - run Behat tests, in this example limiting scope to enrol_manual plugin
* `mdc-debug webserver` - start OrbStack Debugging Shell inside a webserver container
* `mdc-bash db` - start normal Bash shell inside a db container
* `node-init && grunt` - install Node.js in webserver container and run grunt job, note that grunt can be run from plugin subdirectory too
* `mpci-init` - install Moodle Plugin CI
* `mpci-update` - force update of Moodle Plugin CI to latest versions
* `mpci phpcs enrol/manual` - run Moodle Plugin CI for given plugin subdirectory
* `ngrok-init` - install Ngrok
* `ngrok-start` - start Ngrok for public site URL testing

## Project configuration

Each project directory must contain `mdc.env` file which includes Moodle and site configuration settings.
It is also possible to modify default config.php settings by adding `mdc-config.php` file.
File `mdc-compose.yaml` may contain project specific Docker Compose additions.

### Environment variables

You can change the configuration of the docker images by setting various environment variables in `mdc.env` file.
This file is usually placed in your Moodle code directory, however it can be placed in any directory because the bin
scripts are looking for it in the current working directory when executed.

After making changes you must call `mdc-rebuild` to activate them.
If you want to keep your existing data then use `mdc-backup mybackupname` first and after rebuild
restore data using `mdc-restore mybackupname`.

Examples can be found in [mdc/templates/mdc.env](templates/mdc.env) file.

### Customisation of config.php

When using standard MDC config.php copied from [mdc/templates/config.php](templates/config.php) file,
then it is possible to alter $CFG and other site settings by adding a `mdc-config.php project
file which gets included close to the end of config.php.

Adding a new project `mdc-config.php` file requires full MDC rebuild, existing file
can be modified at any time without MDC rebuild.

Examples can be found in [mdc/templates/mdc-config.php](templates/mdc-config.php) file.

### Additional Compose configuration

Instead of environmental variables it is also possible to supply extra compose configuration file.

After making changes you must call `mdc-rebuild` to activate them.
If you want to keep your existing data then use `mdc-backup mybackupname` first and after rebuild
restore data using `mdc-restore mybackupname`.

For example this `mdc-compose.yaml` adds adminer to project:

```yaml
services:
  adminer:
    container_name: "${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}-adminer"
    image: adminer:latest
    depends_on:
      - "db"
```

If used in project directory named 'moodle' then Adminer would be accessible via [https://adminer.moodle.orb.local/](https://adminer.moodle.orb.local/).

## Shared configuration

Configuration options that apply to all projects can be included in `~/.mdc/` in user directory:

* `~/.mdc/mdc.env` - environment defaults for all project
* `~/.mdc/mdc-config.php` - config.php overrides for all projects
* `~/.mdc/mdc-compose.yaml` - additional Docker Compose changes for all projects

The internal format of these shared files is the same as project configuration files.

Adding or modifying these shared file requires full MDC rebuild. The only exception is modification
of existing shared mdc-config.php file which can be done at any time.

## Security recommendations

* MDC cannot be used for production web hosting
* MDC sites are not intended to be accessed from Internet
* Limit Docker ports redirections to 127.0.01 interface
* Always keep macOS firewall enabled and do not allow Docker to listen to incoming connections
* Do not install random additional Moodle plugins without security review
* Do not use Docker tags for obsolete unsupported images unless absolutely necessary (such as PHP 8.0 and 7.4)
* Please report any security problems or improvement ideas!

## PHPUnit testing

To initialise the PHPUnit test environment execute `behat-init` script:

```bash
cd /path/to/moodle/
phpunit-init
```

To run PHPUnit tests execute `phpunit` script, for example:

```bash
cd /path/to/moodle/
phpunit --filter=auth_manual
```

You should see something like this:
```
Moodle 4.1.13 (Build: 20240902), d4f5e92ee156002b95db1ab6f76e25870563e2f6
Php: 8.1.29, pgsql: 16.4 (Debian 16.4-1.pgdg120+1), OS: Linux 6.10.6-orbstack-00249-g92ad2848917c aarch64
PHPUnit 9.5.28 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

.....                                                               5 / 5 (100%)

Time: 00:00.776, Memory: 307.00 MB

OK (5 tests, 17 assertions)
```

Notes:

* If you want to run tests with code coverage reports:
```bash
cd /path/to/moodle/
# Build component configuration
phpunit-util --buildcomponentconfigs
# Execute tests for component
mdc exec webserver php -d pcov.enabled=1 -d pcov.directory=. vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration reportbuilder --coverage-text
```
* See available [Command-Line Options](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/textui.html#textui-clioptions) for further info

## Behat testing

To initialise the Behat test environment execute `behat-init` script: 

```bash
cd /path/to/moodle/
behat-init
```

To run Behat tests execute `behat` script, for example:

```bash
cd /path/to/moodle/
behat --tags=@auth_manual
```

You should see something like this:
```
Moodle 4.1.13 (Build: 20240902), d4f5e92ee156002b95db1ab6f76e25870563e2f6
Php: 8.1.29, pgsql: 16.4 (Debian 16.4-1.pgdg120+1), OS: Linux 6.10.6-orbstack-00249-g92ad2848917c aarch64
Run optional tests:
- Accessibility: Yes
Server OS "Linux", Browser: "chrome"
Started at 02-09-2024, 03:28
...............

2 scenarios (2 passed)
15 steps (15 passed)
0m5.21s (52.11Mb)
```

Notes:

* The behat faildump directory is exposed at https://webserver.moodle.orb.local/_/faildumps/.
* Use `MDC_BEHAT_BROWSER` to switch the browser you want to run the test against.
  You need to recreate your containers using `mdc-rebuild`, if you make any changes in `mdc.env` file.

### VNC debugging

If you want to observe the execution of scenarios in a web browser then
just connect to selenium container using OrbStack container domain name.

You should be able to use any kind of VNC viewer, such as [Real VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)
or standard macOS application _Screen Sharing_.

With the containers running, enter address "selenium.moodle.orb.local" in VNC Viewer
or copy vnc://selenium.moodle.orb.local address into _Safari_ which will open _Screen Sharing_ application
or execute this in terminal:
```bash
open vnc://selenium.moodle.orb.local
```
You will be prompted for a password, the password is 'secret'.

You should be able to see an empty desktop. When you run any Behat tests with @javascript tag
a browser will pop up, and you will see the tests execute.

### Browser inspection 

The only way to inspect headless Chromium/Chrome browser is to use remote debug ports.
Please note the port based debugging may be used also for normal Selenium Chrome/Chromium.

To enable remote inspection modify `mdc.env` file to include:

```
MDC_BEHAT_BROWSER=chromium
MDC_BEHAT_BROWSER_INSPECT_PORT=9229
```

Optionally to force headless mode also include following:

```
MDC_BEHAT_BROWSER_HEADLESS=1
```

1. Open Chrome and go to chrome://inspect
2. Add 127.0.0.1:9229 if not listed yet 
3. Start behat run, for example `behat --tags=@javascript`
4. Click on Remote Target link with your session

## IDE configuration

* [PhpStorm configuration](./README_PhpStorm.md)
* [VSCode configuration](./README_VSCode.md)

## Advanced usage examples

### Grunt

First you need to install appropriate node and npm version in webserver container, for example:

```bash
cd /path/with/mdc.env/
node-init
```

To run grunt use:

```bash
cd /path/with/mdc.env/
grunt
```

### Shared Moodle codebase

Normally you would have Moodle PHP files in the same directory as `mdc.env` file,
and you would be executing mdc scripts form the same directory. However, it is also
possible to create `mdc.env` and `mdc-config.php` files in empty directory.

1. Checkout moodle into a directory, or you can reuse existing moodle project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moodle/moodle.git
```
3. Create or alter config.php file to include code from [mdc/templates/config.php](templates/config.php), optionally start the containers:
```bash
cd moodle
cp ../mdc/templates/config.php ./
mdc-build
cd ..
```
2. Create another directory at the same level for SQL Sever testing:
```bash
mkdir moodle_sqlsrv
cd moodle_sqlsrv
```
3. Add `mdc.env` file with following content:
```
MDC_PHP_VERSION=8.1.29
MDC_DIRROOT=/path/to/moodle
MDC_DB_TYPE=sqlsrv
MDC_DB_VERSION=2019-latest
```
4. Create container:
```bash
mdc-rebuild
```
5. Inspect new instance at [https://webserver.moodle-sqlsrv.orb.local/admin/index.php](https://webserver.moodle-sqlsrv.orb.local/admin/index.php)

### Non-moodle projects

This is an example how the MDC can be abused to run other software.

1. Checkout https://github.com/moodle/devdocs.git code into some directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moodle/devdocs.git
cd devdocs
```
2. Create empty `mdc.env` file:
```bash
touch mdc.env
```
3. Add `mdc-compose.yaml` file containing webserver port override:
```
services:
  webserver:
    labels:
      - dev.orbstack.http-port=3000
```
4. Create containers and install nvm inside webserver container:
```bash
mdc-rebuild
mdc-bash webserver
```
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash

### Public access via ngrok

If you need public web access to your local test server, then you can use ngrok to forward
local container port to a public domain address.

__WARNING: It is not recommended to use MDC with non-ephemeral domains because the default site configuration is not secure,
it is your responsibility to harden the site configuration via mdc-config.php overrides or custom main config.php file.__

1. Sign up for a free or paid ngrok account
2. Create and copy authentication token
3. Optionally add token to `MDC_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` variable in `mdc.evn` file
4. Install and configure ngrok in webserver container using `ngrok.init`, use auth token as first parameter if not included in mdc.env file 
5. Optionally create a new domain for ngrok and add it into `MDC_NGROK_DOMAIN` variable in `mdc.env`
6. Launch ngrok using `ngrok-start`, if you do not specify requested domain as parameter or env setting then random domain is created
7. Copy/past the ngrok web interface URL to browser and start testing.
8. Stop ngrok with CTRL+C or `mdc-restart` when finished with testing.
